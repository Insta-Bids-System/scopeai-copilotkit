# âœ… FIXED: CopilotKit Import Issue

## What was the problem?
The `CopilotSidebar` component was being imported from the wrong package. It should be imported from `@copilotkit/react-ui`, not `@copilotkit/react-core`.

## What was fixed?
1. Moved UI components imports (`CopilotSidebar`, `CopilotPopup`) to `@copilotkit/react-ui`
2. Kept hook imports (`useCopilotAction`, `useCopilotReadable`) in `@copilotkit/react-core`
3. Removed unnecessary `CopilotRuntime` import from frontend code
4. Simplified runtime URL configuration

## Updated Import Structure:
```typescript
// Core hooks and provider
import {
  CopilotKit,
  useCopilotAction,
  useCopilotReadable,
} from '@copilotkit/react-core';

// UI components
import {
  CopilotSidebar,
  CopilotPopup,
} from '@copilotkit/react-ui';

// Styles
import '@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css';
```

## Next Steps to Test Locally:

1. **Add your OpenAI API key**:
   Edit `.env.local` and add your actual API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
   ```

2. **The app is now running at**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Test the application**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - You should see the ScopeAI interface with a CopilotKit sidebar on the right
   - Start chatting with the AI assistant
   - Test the conversation flow:
     - It should ask about your business goals
     - When you mention a problem, it should drill down with "why" questions
     - Data should appear in the main UI as you progress

## GitHub Deployment:

Since the fix is committed, you can now push to GitHub:

```bash
# If you haven't set up the remote yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Insta-Bids-System/scopeai-copilotkit.git

# Push to GitHub:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Vercel Deployment:

Once you've tested locally and pushed to GitHub:

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
4. Deploy!

The application is now working correctly and ready for testing!
