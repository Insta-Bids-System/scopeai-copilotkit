# Debugging CopilotKit Integration Issues

## Current Issue
The CopilotKit frontend is sending requests to the backend, but the AI is not responding correctly to the initial "hello" message. The system instructions are being sent but not properly processed.

## Steps to Debug

### 1. Test Basic Functionality
First, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test` to see if the basic CopilotKit chat is working. This is a minimal implementation without custom actions.

### 2. Check OpenAI API Key
Ensure your OpenAI API key in `.env.local` is valid and has credits:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

### 3. Check Console Errors
Open your browser's developer console (F12) and look for any errors when sending a message.

### 4. Verify Backend is Running
The error suggests the backend is responding (since you're getting a response), but let's verify:
- Check if the Next.js server is running without errors
- Look for any server-side console errors when making requests

### 5. Test with Simpler Instructions
If the test page works, the issue might be with the complex instructions. Try simplifying the instructions in the main app.

### 6. Potential Solutions

#### Solution 1: Update CopilotKit Versions
The issue might be with the CopilotKit version. Try updating to the latest:
```bash
npm update @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/runtime
```

#### Solution 2: Use GPT-3.5-turbo for Testing
In `app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`, try changing the model:
```typescript
model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"  // instead of "gpt-4o"
```

#### Solution 3: Add Debug Logging
Add console.log statements in your route handler to see what's being received:
```typescript
export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  console.log('CopilotKit request received');
  const body = await req.json();
  console.log('Request body:', JSON.stringify(body, null, 2));
  
  // ... rest of the handler
};
```

#### Solution 4: Simplify the Instructions
The instructions might be too complex. Try this simpler version in `components/App.tsx`:

```typescript
instructions={`You are ScopeAI. Start by greeting the user and asking about their role and industry.`}
```

### 7. Alternative Approach
If the actions are not working correctly, you might need to implement them differently. The error suggests the system message is being constructed but the AI isn't using the actions properly.

Consider:
1. Moving some actions to the backend (in the CopilotRuntime)
2. Using a different approach for structuring the conversation
3. Breaking down the complex flow into smaller steps

### 8. Check Network Tab
In the browser developer tools:
1. Go to the Network tab
2. Send a message
3. Look for the request to `/api/copilotkit`
4. Check the request payload and response
5. Verify the actions are being sent correctly

## Next Steps
1. First, verify your OpenAI API key is working
2. Test the simple test page at `/test`
3. Check for any console errors
4. Try the simpler solutions above
5. If still not working, we may need to restructure the approach
